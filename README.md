# Rock, Paper and Scissors!

This is a small project from the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) where I build a simple game of
Rock, Paper and Scissors.

In the first part of the project, I've built the game using only `prompt` to get the choices and console logging the results, however,
later in the lessons from **Odin Project**, I refactored the game to work with a UI.
